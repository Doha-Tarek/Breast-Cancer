# Breast Cancer
Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant

## Objective
- Identifying the problem and Data Sources
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Pre-Processing the Data
- Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model on structured data to detect breast cancer. I used Adem as the optimizer for this model,
it achieved 97.2% accuracy in detecting breast cancer from the inputted data.

## Dataset
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## About Dataset
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
